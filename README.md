## Description

This is a React project that allows users to manipulate a counter and see the date that corresponds to the number of days represented by the counter. The counter can be incremented or decremented by clicking the plus or minus buttons. The user can also adjust the state value, which multiplies the count value to produce the final count displayed. The date is automatically updated whenever the count or state value changes.
